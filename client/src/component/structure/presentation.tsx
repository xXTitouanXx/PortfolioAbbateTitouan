                Hi! My name is Angel Uriot, l’m 23 and I develop things on my free time.
                I like mixing science and math with programming and l’m always looking for new challenges.
                I made simulations, artificial intelligence, websites, games and more... <i>(see the
                <a className="link" href="#projects">project</a> part
                of the site)</i>.
                <br/><br/>

                In 2018, I entered in the <a className="link" href="https://www.polytech.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en" target="_blank">Polytech Paris-Saclay</a>
                french engineering school in IT major to learn more about math, science and software development. I discovered
                a lot of technologies and theorical concepts, but I also put my knowledge into practice in various projects and
                internships, one of which took place in Singapore and greatly expanded my cultural and technical horizons.
                <br/><br/>

                I’m now a software engineer at <a className="link" href="https://www.blablacar.co.uk/" target="_blank">BlaBlaCar</a>,
                the most widely used car-sharing application in the world. I work on the backend of
                <a className="link" href="https://blablacardaily.com/" target="_blank">BlaBlaCar Daily</a>,
                a secondary application targeting short-distance carpooling.

                Besides all this, I'm a content creator on the Internet where I simplify scientific and computer science
                concepts across various social media platforms like YouTube under the pseudonym
